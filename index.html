            <li></li>
        </ul><br>
    </ul>
    <h2>Part Two</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”</li>
        <ul>
            <li>curl -H "Accept: application/json" "https://www.icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate"</li>
        </ul><br>
        <li>Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com</li>

        <li>Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.--></li>
        <li>Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers</li>
        <li>Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.</li>
